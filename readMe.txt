Controllers:

p: pause
v: free camera movement
1-5: choose row
then 1-9: choose column
r: insert resourseGatherer
d: insert defender
c: clear Object 

The game will be a little bit slow if you added more resourseGatherers 

You start with 2 defnders and you can build any resourceGatherers. Whenever you build a resourceGatherer you can add defender.
